A fully Git-managed dotfiles setup for Bash-based systems, built for clarity, reproducibility, and snapshot resilience.

---
## ✨ Important ✨

- There is no support for this personal repo
- Most of this was done with AI
- I promise you certain aspects can & will be weird or broken
  - and with all due respect - ✨ **I don't care** ✨
- If you aren't Richard, I won't stop you from using it. Free internet
- But again: *There is no support for this*

---

## What's Included

- **Kitty terminal config** - with aliases, fonts, and theming
- **Starship prompt** - (Catppuccin Mocha theme)
- **Modular Bash config** via `.bashrc`, `.bashrc-extras`, and `.bashrc-snaps`
-  Quality-of-life CLI tools: + commands:
  - `lsd`, `bat`, `fzf`, `highlight`, `neofetch`
  - Git-aware prompt state
-  **Snapshot management** using Snapper + grub-btrfs:
  - Pre-update snapshot support via `yay-update.sh`
  - Snapshot info + rollback helper
  - Timeline cleanup with age + count management
-  **Dotfile sync** via systemd user timer (`dotfiles-sync.timer`)
-  **Doctor script** to verify symlinks, tools, scripts, and broken links

---

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:richardbs/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
    cd ~/dotfiles
    bash install.sh

This will:

- Create symlinks for:
  - `~/.bashrc` → `~/dotfiles/bashrc`
  - `~/.config/starship.toml` → `~/dotfiles/starship/starship.toml`
  - `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf` → `~/dotfiles/kitty/kitty.conf`
- Optionally install Snapper config if present (`snapshots/snapper-root.conf`)
- Install a systemd user timer to run `sync_dotfiles.sh` twice daily

---

## Keeping Dotfiles in Sync

After making local changes:

    bash ~/dotfiles/sync_dotfiles.sh

This will:

- Commit & push changes if your working directory is clean
- Pull remote changes if behind
- Notify via `notify-send` if triggered by systemd
- Run `dotfiles_doctor.sh` to check for config drift

---

## Notes on `.bashrc` & Structure

- `~/.bashrc` is fully Git-managed via symlink
- It sources:
  - `~/dotfiles/terminal/.bashrc-snaps` — snapshot helper aliases/functions
  - `~/dotfiles/terminal/.bashrc-extras` — CLI tools, aliases, completions
- All CLI helpers and aliases are scoped to Bash
- Dotfiles are declarative — `.bashrc` is never patched, only replaced

---

## Diagnostic

Run this anytime:

    bash ~/dotfiles/dotfiles_doctor.sh

This checks:

- Dotfile symlink correctness
- Script presence + executable bit
- Broken symlinks inside `~/dotfiles`
- Required CLI tools (like `starship`, `kitty`)
- Systemd timer status

## System Assumptions

This personal dotfiles setup is designed for:

- Arch Linux (or derivatives like EndeavourOS)
- Bash-based systems only
- Kitty terminal + Starship prompt
- Snapper configured with `grub-btrfs`
- Most importantly: *For Richard*
  - Not Richard? I won't stop you, but there is no support for this. You're on your own
